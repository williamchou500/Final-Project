  <p><br>1. What have you done so far? <br><br>First, we tried several different regressions to predict the glucose levels from the chosen dataset. After trial and error, we chose Random Forest regression which showed the l most accurate predictions out of all regressions we tried. We used Random Forest Classifier to determine the magnitude of each nutrient value present in the dataset: calories, total carbs, dietary fiber, sugar, total fat, protein as well as time, Hb1Ac, and gender, to predict the amount glucose levels would increase within 2 hours after eating. We used this to make a tool where you can input nutrition information and other data to get a predicted glucose level after eating. We get these predictions by adding the predicted increase in glucose after 2 hours to resting glucose levels (currently set to 110). These results are logged and graphed, additionally, a weekly summary is made available after 7 days/logs. The graph shows a spike of glucose corresponding to the meal consumed. The face identifying whether the spike occurred was added to be replaced by a different animation later.</p>
  <p><br>2. What will be the most challenging of your project to design and why? <br><br>For our project, we still need to implement the ability to assign multiple meals to one day so that it better represents glucose trends in a day. Furthermore, we need to enhance our visualization to make it more creative and memorable as it is very simple right now. Additionally, we need to perform more calculations so the line generated by the tool is more accurate and applicable. It will be difficult to account for the many variables that affect how much glucose values increase after a meal, as factors like stress, how active the sample is, etc. can impact how fast and much person‚Äôs glucose changes after a meal and glucose spike. We also currently have a plan to turn the line generated into a track for a cart to drive over and show different results depending on the size and frequency of spikes. This will be difficult as it is something very new to all of us and not something that has been showcased in any lectures yet. We are trying to create a game-like exploratory visualization from this prototype.</p>
